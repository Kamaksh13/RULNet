# **RULNet** ðŸ”‹

RULNet focuses on predicting the Remaining Useful Life (RUL) of lithium-ion batteries by leveraging advanced machine learning techniques. Our approach employs Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) architectures, including LSTM, BiLSTM, GRU, and BiGRU, to accurately model the degradation patterns of batteries over time. By ensembling these models, we enhance prediction accuracy and mitigate the limitations of individual architectures.

**Key Features:**

  â€¢ RNN-Based Predictive Models: Utilizes Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), Bidirectional LSTM (BiLSTM), Gated Recurrent Units (GRU), and Bidirectional GRU (BiGRU) to capture complex degradation behaviors.
  
  â€¢ Ensemble Learning: Combines the strengths of multiple RNN models to deliver robust and accurate RUL predictions.
  
  â€¢ NASA Dataset: The dataset from NASA Ames Prognostics Center of Excellence includes comprehensive data on lithium-ion batteries, such as voltage, current, temperature, and impedance, collected over cycles until end-of-life (30% capacity fade).
  
  â€¢ Real-World Applications: Provides actionable insights for industries relying on battery health predictions, such as electric vehicles and energy storage systems.
